# check-yo-self
Final Solo project Mod 1

The 'Check Yo' Self' project is an app that creates and organizes to-do lists.  The app collects user input and creates task lists based on that information.  In a final iteration, the user will be able to create, organize, and modify these lists with their information persisting in the user's local storage.  

The two main goals of the project are:
  1. Use of classes to instantiate objects;
  2. Implementation of local storage;

Proper use of the above mentioned processes was the biggest struggle in this project.  Our previous projects implemented these things, but in more basic forms.  Getting changes made to the data-model to persist on page-load is incredibly difficult and (at the time of this writing) have not yet been completed.  I felt relatively comfortable with Iteration 0 of the project, although I still needed some help.  However, Iteration 1 was one where I had no idea where to begin.  There was some functionality that I attempted but could not successfully complete in time, so I commented them out.  

The biggest win of this project was how naturally the basic functions came to me and how comfortable I was coming up with them without reference.  There is always room to improve, of course, but my understanding has improved a lot.  I am also proud of my overall comp recreation.

Overall, I am very happy with the parts of the project that I do have.  I believe that with more time, I could have completed more of the project.  This was a very challenging project and I would like to get the experience and practice with more of this.
